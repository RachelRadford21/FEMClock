# FEMClock
Front End Mentor Clock Challenge

This project allowed me to understand concepts I had been struggling with. 
Coming from a JS background, native swift api calls can be difficult. 
With this challenge I was able to teach myself how to make multiple api calls 
& use data from the previous call as query parameters for the next call (chaining).
